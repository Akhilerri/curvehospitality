```

Then open http://localhost:4173 to test the production build locally.

- **Framework Preset**: Other
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`
- **Node Version**: 20.x (automatic)

## 🌐 What's Deployed

Your static site includes:

✅ **All Pages**:
- Home
- About
- Services (with service details)
- Products (with categories and details)
- Portfolio (with case studies)
- Process
- Resources (guides and blog)
- Blog (with individual posts)
- Contact

✅ **Features**:
- Responsive design

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### This is a Static Deployment

- ✅ All frontend functionality works
- ✅ Navigation and routing work
- ✅ Forms display correctly
- ❌ Form submissions won't save (mock responses only)
- ❌ No backend API
- ❌ No database connectivity
- ❌ No file uploads

All data is served from mock files in `client/src/data/`.

### For Full-Stack Deployment

If you need backend functionality later:
1. Set up Vercel Serverless Functions
2. Migrate to PostgreSQL (Vercel Postgres or Neon)
3. Update API endpoints
4. Configure environment variables

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for more details.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Vercel

1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure Node version is 20.x
3. Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`

### 404 on Routes

- Vercel.json should handle this automatically
- If issues persist, check that `vercel.json` is committed to git

### Assets Not Loading

- Verify assets are in `client/public` or `client/src/assets`
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure paths are relative, not absolute

## 📞 Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Review `DEPLOYMENT.md`
3. Test locally with `npm run build && npm run preview`

## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test thoroughly**:
   - All pages load
   - Navigation works
   - Mobile responsive
   - Forms display correctly

2. **Configure custom domain** (optional):
   - Go to Project Settings → Domains
   - Add your custom domain
   - Update DNS records

3. **Set up analytics** (optional):
   - Vercel Analytics
   - Google Analytics
   - Custom tracking

4. **Monitor performance**:
   - Check Vercel Analytics
   - Run Lighthouse audits
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals
